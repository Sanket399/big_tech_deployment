# Big Tech Deployment: CI/CD Learning Project

This project is a hands-on experiment to understand how large-scale applications are built, deployed, and managed in real-world environments.  

The app itself is trivial — just a basic one-line page — but the main focus is the **CI/CD pipeline and deployment workflow**, designed to mimic the practices of big tech companies.

---

## Purpose

- Learn to **automate builds, tagging, and Docker image management**.
- Practice **deployment via SSH** to a virtual machine.
- Implement **rollback mechanisms** based on health checks.
- Explore **Git tagging** as part of release management.
- Set the foundation for **multi-environment deployments** and **Kubernetes orchestration** in the future.

---

## Key Learnings So Far

- Versioning Docker images dynamically using GitHub run numbers.
- Using GitHub Actions for **full CI/CD automation**.
- Handling deployment failures and **rolling back safely**.
- Integrating **Docker Hub** into CI pipelines.
- Basic health checks to ensure deployed services are running.

---

## Future Plans

- Introduce separate **staging and production environments**.
- Migrate deployments to **Kubernetes clusters**.
- Implement **more complex apps** with real functionality.
- Experiment with **advanced CI/CD features**, such as blue-green deployments, canary releases, and automated monitoring.

This project is mainly a personal sandbox to **experiment and learn the deployment practices of big tech**.
